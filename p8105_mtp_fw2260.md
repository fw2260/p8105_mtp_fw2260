The `dogweights` dataset contains the weights of three dogs, Simone,
Gagne, and Raisin in pounds, along with some occasional notes, from 2018
to 2020. The dogs are weighed every few days and a standard weight is
weighed occasionally as well to ensure accuracy.

``` r
dogweights_df <- 
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx",
    range = "B2:G207") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(notes = x6) %>% 
  filter(date != "s") %>% 
  mutate(
    date = as.numeric(date),
    date = excel_numeric_to_date(date, date_system = "modern"))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...6

``` r
notes_df <- 
  select(dogweights_df, c(date, notes)) %>% 
  drop_na()

dogweights_df <-
  select(dogweights_df, !notes) %>% 
  pivot_longer(raisin:std,
               names_to = "name",
               values_to = "weight") %>% 
  relocate(date, name, weight) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  separate(weight, c("lbs","oz"), " ") %>% 
  mutate(lbs = as.numeric(lbs),
         oz = as.numeric(oz),
         oz = oz/16,
         weight = lbs + oz) %>% 
  select(date, name, weight)
```

    ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 2 rows [138,
    ## 365].

``` r
write_csv(dogweights_df, "./data/weights_cleaned.csv")
write_csv(notes_df, "./data/notes_cleaned.csv")

view(dogweights_df)
```

The cleaned `dogweights` dataset is 552 rows and 3 columns and does not
contain notes. One entry between 1/19/19 and 1/26/19 had an invalid date
so it was dropped. The weights in the original dataset were entered as
pounds and ounces separated by a space, which were converted into pounds
with decimals instead, for ease of visualization later. Cells that had
no weight entry were dropped.

The notes from the original dataset were transferred to a separate
`notes` dataset that contains just the notes and the dates they were
taken on.
