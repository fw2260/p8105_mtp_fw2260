The `dogweights` dataset contains the weights of three dogs, Gagne,
Simone, and Raisin, in pounds, along with some occasional notes, from
2018 to 2020. The dogs were weighed every few days and a standard weight
was weighed occasionally as well to ensure accuracy. This report will
explain the process of cleaning this dataset and performing some
exploratory analyses and visualizations on it.

## Cleaning the dataset

Importing, cleaning, then exporting the `dogweights` dataset as csv
files:

``` r
dogweights_df <- 
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx",
    range = "B2:G207") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(notes = x6) %>% 
  filter(date != "s") %>% 
  mutate(
    date = as.numeric(date),
    date = excel_numeric_to_date(date, date_system = "modern"))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...6

``` r
notes_df <- 
  select(dogweights_df, c(date, notes)) %>% 
  drop_na()

dogweights_df <-
  select(dogweights_df, !notes) %>% 
  pivot_longer(raisin:std,
               names_to = "name",
               values_to = "weight") %>% 
  relocate(date, name, weight) %>% 
  mutate(
    weight = recode(weight, "1810" = "18 10", "1803" = "18 03", "7 15" = "17 15")
  ) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  separate(weight, c("lbs","oz"), " ") %>% 
  mutate(lbs = as.numeric(lbs),
         oz = as.numeric(oz),
         oz = oz/16,
         weight = lbs + oz) %>% 
  select(date, name, weight)

write_csv(dogweights_df, "./data/weights_cleaned.csv")
write_csv(notes_df, "./data/notes_cleaned.csv")
```

The notes column from the original dataset was transferred to a separate
`notes` dataframe that contains just the notes and the dates they were
taken on.

To make the remaining dataset tidier, the four columns that contained
the weights of each dog and the standard object were combined into one
`weight` column. The weights were also originally entered as pounds and
ounces separated by a space, which were converted into pounds with
decimals instead, for ease of visualization later.

**Inconsistent entries:** Originally, the entry between 2019-01-19 and
2019-01-26 had an invalid date so it was deleted. Raisin’s weights on
2018-10-22 and 2019-07-23 were missing a space so a space was added for
consistency with the other entries. Also, Raisin’s weight on 2019-08-14
was presumably missing a tens digit, so one was added. Finally, empty
weight entries were deleted.

## Exploratory data analyses

The cleaned `dogweights` dataset is 552 rows and 3 columns. There are
201 unique dates in the dataset.

Making a table of the number of observations for each dog, along with
their average weight and the standard deviation:

``` r
dogweights_df %>% 
  filter(name != "std") %>% 
  count(name)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   name       n
    ##   <chr>  <int>
    ## 1 gagne    119
    ## 2 raisin   201
    ## 3 simone   192

## Visualizations

``` r
distr_plot <- 
  dogweights_df %>% 
  filter(name != "std") %>% 
  mutate(name = recode(name, "raisin" = "Raisin", "gagne" = "Gagne", "simone" = "Simone")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = weight, fill = name)) +
  geom_violin() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Dog weights distribution",
    x = "Dog",
    y = "Weight (pounds)"
  )

time_plot <-
  dogweights_df %>% 
  filter(name != "std") %>% 
  mutate(name = recode(name, "raisin" = "Raisin", "gagne" = "Gagne", "simone" = "Simone")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight, color = name)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Dog weights over time",
    x = "Date (YYYY-MM)",
    y = "Weight (pounds)",
    color = "Dog",
    caption = "Data from dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx"
  )

distr_plot + time_plot
```

When Gagne was healthy, Gagne and Simone were about the same weight (11
pounds or so) and Raisin was heavier by about 7 pounds. Over time,
Gagne’s weight rapidly decreased months before its death, Raisin lost
two pounds, and Simone’s weight stayed relatively constant.
